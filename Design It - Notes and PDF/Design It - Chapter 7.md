# Chapter 7 - Create a Foundation with Patterns

**architecture pattern** - a reusable solution to a specific problem

**Layers Pattern** - Partitioning code into distinct and independent layers organized around a specific set of related concerns

![Layers Pattern Examples](<images/Layers Pattern Examples.png>)

**Ports and Adapters Pattern** - isolates core business logic so it can be used in a variety of contexts and tested in isolation from components that provide data and events

![Ports and Adapters Example](<images/Ports and Adapters Example.png>)

**Pipe-and-Filter Pattern** - each component called a filter is responsible for a single transformation or data operation. Data is streamed from one filter to the next as quickly as possible, and data operations occur in parallel. Loosely coupled filters can be reused and combined in different ways to create new pipelines

**batch sequential pattern** - similar to pipe-and-filter. Stages of a batch-sequential system operate in turn, one at a time instead of in parallel like in a pipe-and-filter system


**Service-Oriented Architecture Pattern** - independent components are implemented as services, which provide specific functionality

<div style="page-break-after: always; visibility: hidden"> 
\pagebreak 
</div>

**Publish-Subscribe Pattern** - producers and consumers exist independently and unaware of one another. Consumers subscribe to events published by producers

**Shared-Data Pattern** - multiple components access data through a common data store. No single component is entirely responsible for the data or data store

**Open Source Contribution Pattern** - teams are given responsibility for developing specific architectural components but are not expected to be the only contributing developers. For this pattern to be successful, teams must know they are responsible for specific components and have a firm understanding of where their components fit within the larger context

**Big Ball of Mud Pattern** - no defined elements or relations

**Architectural mismatch** - occurs when the assumptions made about how a component will be used conflicts with that componentâ€™s current use

**Multi-Tier Pattern** - runtime structures are organized into logical groups. These logical groups may be allocated to specific physical components, such as a server or cloud platform. similar to the layers pattern

![Multi-Tier Example](<images/Multi-Tier Example.png>)

**Center of Competence Pattern (CoC)** - a team of experts is charged with defining patterns, establishing best practices, developing support tools, and providing education for a subset of the architecture
